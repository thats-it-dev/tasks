# Overview

This is a frontend template for web-based projects that ensures consistency across all applications. it utilizes react, tailwinds, thatsit/ui, typescript, dexie, and zustand. Every app we build with this template should be local first and have the ability to work offline.

## Guidelines

- ALWAYS use thatsit/ui components for UI. avoid creating anything custom unless absolutely necessary. ask first.
- Use tailwind for styling.
- prioritize simplicity.

- `pnpm install` - installs dependencies
- `pnpm dev` - starts the development server
- `pnpm build` - builds the project for production
